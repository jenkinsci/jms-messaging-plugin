        Environment variable to hold received message content.
        Note that a second environment variable "${VARIABLE}_HEADERS" is created for the message headers.
    </p>
    <p>
        To pass message content by file instead, configure as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            CI Build Trigger<br>
            <br>
	    Create a FileParameter on the job with the name of the variable specified here. If
	    you want the message headers as a file as well, create a FileParameter named "${VARIABLE}_HEADERS".
        </li>
	<br>
        <li>
            Job and Pipeline Steps<br>
            <br>
	    Check the "Use files instead of environment variables" checkbox. This will create
	    files in the workspace with the same names as the environment variables.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
