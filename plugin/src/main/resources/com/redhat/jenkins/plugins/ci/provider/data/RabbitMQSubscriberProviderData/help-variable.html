    <p>Environment variable to hold received message content.</p>
    <p>
        To pass message content by file instead, configure as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            CI Build Trigger<br>
            <br>
	    Create a FileParameter on the job with the name of the variable specified here.
        </li>
	<br>
        <li>
            Job and Pipeline Steps<br>
            <br>
	    Check the "Use files instead of environment variables" checkbox. This will create
	    files in the workspace with the same names as the environment variables.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
