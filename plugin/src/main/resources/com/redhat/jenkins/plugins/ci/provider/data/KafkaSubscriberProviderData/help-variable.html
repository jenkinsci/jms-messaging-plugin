        Environment variable to hold received message content. Note that the entire Kafka record (not
	including the "value" field) in JSON format will also be available in the environment variable
	"${VARIABLE}_RECORD".
    </p>
    <p>
        To pass message content by file instead, configure as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            CI Build Trigger<br>
            <br>
	    Create a FileParameter on the job with the name of the variable specified here. If
	    you want the Kafka record as a file as well, create a FileParameter named "${VARIABLE}_RECORD".
        </li>
	<br>
        <li>
            Job and Pipeline Steps<br>
            <br>
	    Check the "Use files instead of environment variables" checkbox. This will create
	    files in the workspace with the same names as the environment variables.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
