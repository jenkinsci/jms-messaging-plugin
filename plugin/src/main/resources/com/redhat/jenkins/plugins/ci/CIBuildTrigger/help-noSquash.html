<div>
  <p>Schedule a new job for every triggering message.</p>
  <p>Normally if a job is queued and another triggering message is received, a new
     job is not submitted and the job is "squashed" into the job already queued. Checking 
     this option forces a new job to be submitted for every triggering message that is
     received.
