The JMS Messaging Plugin provides the following functionality:

-   A build trigger to submit jenkins jobs upon receipt of a matching
    message.
-   A post-build action that may be used to submit a message to the
    topic upon the completion of a job

JMS Messaging Providers

-   This plugin supports the following JMS Message Provider types
    -   ActiveMQ
    -   FedMsg
    -   RabbitMQ

Older versions of this plugin may not be safe to use. Please review the
following warnings before using an older version:

-   [SSRF
    vulnerability](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-02-19/#SECURITY-1033){.external-link}

## Set Up

### Global Configuration

Before the plugin may be used, you must add a JMS Messaging Provider.
This will provide the ability to send and receive messages. Below is a
list of currently supported JMS Message Providers:

-   ActiveMQ
-   FedMsg
-   RabbitMQ

.confluence-content-image-border}

## Triggering

To enable the CI trigger, go to the job configuration page and add click
the check box "CI Event" under the Build Triggers section. Enabling the
trigger on a job requires two additional pieces of information:

-   Provider Name
-   JMS Selector

![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/103088201/trigger.png?version=1&modificationDate=1482413490000&api=v2){.confluence-embedded-image
.confluence-content-image-border}  
The complete documentation for JMS selectors can be found here:
<http://activemq.apache.org/selectors.html>

## Message Types

In the image above, the selector contains **CI\_TYPE =
'\<message-type\>'**

The valid values for **'\<message-type\>'** can be found in the
"**Type**" column in the table below:

| Message                                                | Description                                                                                                        | Type                                 |

## Build Steps

### CI Notifier

This plugin provides a build step for publishing messages to the topic
upon job completion. To add the CI Notifier build step, go to the job
configuration page and select the "CI Notifier" option.

Adding the step to the job requires some additional information:

-   Provider name
-   Message type
-   Message properties
-   Message content.

The full list of message types available in the drop-down menu can be
found in the Message Type table above.

![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/103088201/ci-notifier.png?version=1&modificationDate=1482416658000&api=v2){.confluence-embedded-image
.confluence-content-image-border}

### CI Subscriber

This plugin provides a build step to wait for a specific message. To add
the CI Subscriber build step, go to the job configuration page and
select the "CI Subscriber" option.

Adding the step to the job requires some additional information:

-   Provider name
-   JMS Selector
-   Variable
-   Timeout

The build step will set an environment variable with the name from
Variable with a value of the message content.

![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/103088201/ci-subscriber-build.png?version=1&modificationDate=1482416989000&api=v2){.confluence-embedded-image
.confluence-content-image-border}

## Post-build steps

### CI Notifier

See above.

## Pipeline Support

### Triggers

The CI trigger is available via the triggers section in a declarative pipeline:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
triggers {
    ciBuildTrigger(noSquash: false,
        providerList: [ activeMQSubscriber(name: 'Red Hat UMB',
                        checks: [
                            [
                                expectedValue: '^foo.*bar$',
                                field: '$.msg.tag'
                            ]
                        ],
                        overrides: [topic: 'Consumer.rh-jenkins-ci-plugin.8dad9900-abcabc.VirtualTopic.eng.ci.example.durable.test.abcabc'] )
        ]
    )
}
```

## Job DSL Support

Here is a usage example for Job DSL:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
ciBuildTrigger {
    providers {
      providerDataEnvelope {
        providerData {
          activeMQSubscriber {
            name("Red Hat UMB")
            overrides {
              def uuid = "4ba46bbc-949b-11e8-b83f-54ee754ea14c"
              topic("Consumer.rh-jenkins-ci-plugin.${uuid}.VirtualTopic.eng.ci.redhat-container-image.pipeline.running")
            }
            // Message Checks
            checks {
              msgCheck {
                field('$.artifact.type')
                expectedValue("cvp")
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    noSquash(true)
  }
}
```
### Steps

This plugin provides the steps when using the Jenkins Pipeline feature:

-   sendCIMessage
    -   This is the Freestyle CI Notifier Build and Publisher step
        sibling.
-   waitForCIMessage
    -   This is the Freestyle CI Subscriber Build step sibling.

Here are some examples:

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
node('master') {
   // Send a message that CodeQualityChecksDone
    def sendResult = sendCIMessage \
        providerName: 'default', \
        messageContent: 'some content', \
        messageProperties: 'CI_STATUS = passed', \
        messageType: 'CodeQualityChecksDone'
    // echo sent message id and content
    echo sendResult.getMessageId()
    echo sendResult.getMessageContent()
}
```

and

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
node('master') {
    // Wait for message and store message content in variable
    def msgContent = waitForCIMessage \
         providerName: 'default', \
         selector: "CI_TYPE = 'code-quality-checks-done' and CI_STATUS = 'passed'"
    echo "msgContent = " + msgContent
}
```
